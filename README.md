# Book Tracker

This is a simple book tracking application which can be used to manage your reading goal for the year. 
The application UI is built using pysimplegui. 

Add each book to your backlog using the UI. Selecting status will calculate the number of pages you need to read per day to reach your goal. 
Your backlog can be edited using the UI.
